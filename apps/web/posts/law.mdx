## Introduction

Introduction to the blog post goes here.

Comparing "Listening to the Law" with "Reading the Constitution" by Stephen Breyer.

## Notes

### Listening to the Law

- By Amy Coney Barrett
- Contents
  - Brief overview of her life (brevity is characteristic of originalist whose background shouldn't matter)
  - Window into the legal profession
  - Potted history of the Constitution, Federalist Papers, etc

- Arguments
  - Defining feature of constitution is that it's written down
    - Text makes the terms transparent (people don't agree on a handshake or verbal assurances)
      - Protects from fading memories and strategic denials
      - Prevents text from being easily undone
    - Puts people on notice of their their rights so they can enforce them against the government
    - Puts government officials on notice of their obligations
  - Authority is derived from continuity and us not changing the laws
  - Inflexibility has upsides
    - It can be changed, is limited, isn't full of strict rules, etc
    - Constitution has both rules and standards (like reasonableness tests)
  - Her views on unenumerated rights
    - Text history and tradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty
    - Assisten dying isn't an example
    - Similar with Dobbes
  - It's fundamentally a legal text

### Reading the Constitution

- By Stephen Breyer
