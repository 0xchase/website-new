## Introduction

Like many disputes that have been left for philosophers, the question of whether humans have free will is particularlly fraught. The points of contention include not only the answer to the question itself, but also the meaning and nature of all the concepts presupposed by the question, and though it superficially takes the form of an empirical question about human psychology, it's unclear if any experiment would resolve it, or even if empirical results are relevant evidence in principal. These layers of confounds have created a landscape where people with mutually contradictory positions have high confidence in their views, and even people who nominally share a stance often still disagree about the *reasons* that view is correct. The issue remains fraught after centuries of debate.

### What I’ll cover

I’m going to offer my perspective on the free will debate, <Assumption>with a particular focus on explaining why it seems intractable, what explains people’s conflicting intuitions about the issue</Assumption>, and the foundational reasons people continue to disagree and talk past each other.

In the end <Evidence>I will conclude that compatibilism is correct</Evidence>, and that the <Claim>apparent incompatibliity between determinism and free will comes from misguided intutions people have about how their minds relate to the world</Claim> due to the stranglhold our pre-scientific "folk" theory of mind has on our intuitions. I'll attempt to show that selectively repudiating the false aspects of this theory and extending the naturalistic project to cover own decision making processes clears up many demonstrably false misconceptions people have about the implications of determinism, and dissolves the apparent threat it poses to human freedom.

Given how fraught this debate is, this post will be substantially devoted to investigating the right way to *reason* about the debate, so as to resolve it in principal. I don’t think one can fully understand this issue by jumping to what I consider to be the correct view, so I intend to walk the reader through the landscape of perspectives, successively showing the confusions implicit in each one. In explaining the alternative views I'll sometimes repeat assertions I think are *false* or based on common *misconceptions*, which we'll clear up as we go along.

The primary contribution of this post is to the compatibilism/incompatibilism debate. I'll briefly cover why determinism must be true in order to modivate and contextualize the rest of my discussion, but I won't be saying anything particularlly novel about it - I consider it to be basically a closed matter and libertariaism to be a dead position, so my attention will be focused elsewhere.

## Determinism

(harris talk as a reference)

One of the most profound shifts brought about by the scientific revolution has been the replacement of teleological explanations with mechanistic ones. The dominant pre-scientific theory of nature concieved of objects as having inherent powers like X, Y, and Z, and inherent purposes like A, B, and C. The sciences replaced this approach with the practice of writing down mathematical *laws of nature*, that could be validated or falsified experimentally. Despite the fact that these laws were meachanical, soulless, and devoid of the intentionality humans so readily project onto th eexternal world, the superiority of this approach was demonstrated by the unparalled success of these laws at making empirical predictions, and the extraordinary success of the application of these theories to developing new technologies.

<Assumption>So perhaps the broadest conclusion to be taken from this revolution is that our world can be described by *laws of nature* - the most fundemental being the laws of physics. Though the final theory of physics hasn't yet been discovered, the laws we do know have be verified with extraordinary precision in particle accelerators - we know of no experimental violations of quantum field theory, and we have every reason to think these laws apply universally.</Assumption>

Naively, this fact poses a problem for human freedom because these laws seem to completely and inviolably determine how the world evolves over time. Given some initial conditions, in principal one could apply these laws to exactly predict future events, without making any reference to human intentions, decision, or actions. One might wonder what room is left for human decisions or actions to change the inexorable mechanistic evolution of the world towards the singular future that has been predetermined since the big bang.

Furthermore, we have every reason to think that these mechanisms apply not only to inert objects like particles, rocks, and celestial bodies, but to our brains and decision-making processes themselves. After all, our brains are composed of neurons, our neurons are composed of cells, and these cells are composed of fundemental particles. Even without considering this reduction, we have fairly accurate differential models of neurons and little reason to think that any stochastic deviation from these models has anything to do with a magic decision making substance.

The more we learn about how the brain works, the more we begin to seem like mechanical devices just like toy robots, just like computer programs. We just operate on neurons instead of transistors. Not that this different matters, because our neurons can be *simulated* with transitors. Is there any metaphysical barrier to simulating our brains on a computer?

At the level of genes + environment

Furthermore, consider simply introspecting. <Claim>Words just come to you</Claim>. How many of our decision are even conscious? This point is driven home by the libet experiments, which show researchers can predict your actions before you're even consciously aware of it.

<Claim>Indeterminism objection, is irrelevant.</Claim> Dice isn't a decision. The problem wasn't determinism exactly, it's that our decisions are law-like at all.

And now we're ready to see, that though the sciences provided a powerful validation of this picture, our central conclusion can be arrived at a-priori. Two options: determinism and indeterminism. We happen to have good reason to think our world evolves deterministically, but even if we didn't, this simple binary would still apply. Neither is good for human freedom. What other options are there? Even if we introduce a magic substance. The same problem applies. The problem for human freedom is essentially a logical matter. Even in an invented world. Not only does freedom not exist in our world, it's impossible to conieve of a world where we would be free.

### Positions

<Evidence>This image of ourselves as a kind of mechanical device may seem difficult to reconcile with our intuitive conception of ourselves as free agents. If the decisions you'll make have been fixed since the big bang and the factors that influence your decisions are beyond your control one might wonder what role is left for human decision making. This tension has led some philosophers to accept incompatibilism - the view that free will and determinism are incompatible.</Evidence>While some incompatibilists have maintained the existence of free will and concluded from this that determinism must be *false*, the vast majority have accepted determinism and concluded that there's no free will. On the other hand there are compatibilists, who don't think determinism is a threat to free will, and so may accept both.

<DefinitionCallout term="Compatibilism">
Compatibilism is the philosophical position that free will and determinism are compatible. Compatibilists argue that even if our actions are determined by prior causes, we can still be considered free agents if our actions align with our desires and intentions.

<DefinitionCallout term="Incompatibilism">
Incompatibilism is the view that free will and determinism are fundamentally incompatible. Incompatibilists believe that if determinism is true, then free will cannot exist, and vice versa.

In the end I will conclude that compatibilism is correct, and that the apparent incompatibliity between determinism and free will comes from misguided intutions people have about how their minds relate to the world due to the stranglhold our pre-scientific "folk" theory of mind has on our intuitions. I'll attempt to show that selectively repudiating the false aspects of this theory and extending the naturalistic project to cover own decision making processes clears up many demonstrably false misconceptions people have about the implications of determinism, and dissolves the apparent threat it poses to human freedom.
